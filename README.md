# craneMaps

This builds on material in Migration Mapping in my version of the
[Earth Data Analtyics](https://github.com/byandell-Tribal/EarthDataAnalytics)
module on
[Species Distribution Coding Challenge](https://github.com/earthlab-education/species-distribution-coding-challenge-byandell)

My goal is to map all crane species stewarded by the
[International Crane Foundation](https://savingcranes.org/).
This is early days of translating from python into R to use
[rgbif](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif)
and other tools.
